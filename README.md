# CookingByTheBook

## Limitations 
Here we can make a brainstormy list of things, which we come across that should be mentioned in the discussion section of our report. 

 - The way that we present users with results, has influence on their rating. A dish that is presented with a nice picture and a appetizing title is more likely to be accepted by a user, than essentially the same dish, but presented as a list of instructions. Possibly including a 5 hour cooking window. The user might be turned off by that and rejects the recipe.
