## Limitations 
Here we can make a brainstormy list of things, which we come across that should be mentioned in the discussion section of our report. 

 - The way that we present users with results, has influence on their rating. A dish that is presented with a nice picture and a appetizing title is more likely to be accepted by a user, than essentially the same dish, but presented as a list of instructions. Possibly including a 5 hour cooking window. The user might be turned off by that and rejects the recipe. 
 
 - If we use a similarity measure applied by comparing ingredient strings, e.g. "chicken beef koriander maple-syrup", with the recipe's ingredient list: Similiarity is measured based on string "equalitiveness", this has the desired effect that 'koriander' matches perfect with 'koriander', but the undesired effect that 'nut' will be more similar to 'cut' than to 'macadamia'.
