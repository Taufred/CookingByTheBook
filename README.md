# CookingByTheBook
## Dear teacher: 

Thanks for stopping by. You can find all code that was created for this project in here. If you want to rerun things, you would have to install Elasticsearch first and run a local cluster. You can find the (simple) instructions here: 
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started-install.html

You would have to unzip the data file containing the recipes. Apologies for the inconvenience. Happy recipe hunting!
